  <h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
  <div class="red-underline"></div>
  </section>
  <section class="description">
  <p>This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Rowen Education (further referred to as “School”) collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from users (each, a “Student”) of the School. This Privacy Policy applies to the School and all Courses offered by the School.</p>

  <h2>Personal identification information</h2>
  <p>We may collect personal identification information from Students in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Students enroll in the School or a Course within the School, subscribe to a newsletter, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available in our School. Students may visit the School anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Students only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Students can refuse to supply personal identification information, but doing so may prevent them from engaging in certain School-related activities.</p>

  <h2>How we use collected information</h2>
  <p>The School may collect and use Students’ personal identification information for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To improve customer service:</strong> Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>To personalize user experience:</strong> We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Students as a group use the services and resources provided in our School.</li>
    <li><strong>To send periodic emails:</strong> We may use Student email addresses to send Students information and updates pertaining to their order. Student email addresses may also be used to respond to Student inquiries, questions, or other requests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing your personal information</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent Student personal identification information to others. Our hosting services are located in the United States, while our office is located in Zurich, Switzerland.</p>

  <h2>Third party websites</h2>
  <p>Students may find advertising or other content in our School that link to the websites and services of our partners, suppliers, advertisers, sponsors, licensors, and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these websites and are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our School. In addition, these websites or services, including their content and links, may be constantly changing. These websites and services may have their own privacy policies and customer service policies. Browsing and interaction on any other website, including websites which have a link to our Student, is subject to that website's own terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>The School has the discretion to update this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage Students to frequently check this page for any changes. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of modifications.</p>

  <h2>Your acceptance of these terms</h2>
  <p>By enrolling in the School, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not enroll in the School. Your continued enrollment in the School following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.</p>

  <h2>Withdrawal of your data</h2>
  <p>If you want us to delete or withdraw your data, you need to send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@roweneducation.com">info@roweneducation.com</a>.</p>
