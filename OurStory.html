  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    Our story begins in early 2019, when Daniel, founder of Rowen Education, started helping friends navigate the university application process. Having just completed his bachelor's degree at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) and begun a master’s program at the London School of Economics (LSE), he continued offering this support in parallel with his studies and eventually also investigated the most optimal uses of artificial intelligence in academic career counselling within his master’s thesis, while also presenting at various high schools to audiences of 150+ students about the academic system and associated opportunities. By having himself received study offers from universities such as Columbia University in the City of New York, New York University (NYU), or University College London (UCL), he was able to help each student gain admission to their top-choice postgraduate programs, including institutions such as the University of Vienna, the Technical University of Denmark, and ETH Zurich.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the pandemic struck, the project was put on hold, and Daniel shifted his focus toward physics and mathematics, which he pursued at institutions such as Trinity College Dublin or ETH Zurich, among others. Since his passion for the academic endeavour never left him, five years later, while studying at ETH Zurich, he revisited his earlier passion for academic and career counselling by getting an ETH certificate for Coaching Students and decided to rebuild the whole service.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this time with a broader and more holistic approach to navigating the academic system at both the high school and university levels, and not just the application process but in its full spectrum. Designed to allow all students to reach their true potential and thrive in the ever-changing world by becoming leaders of tomorrow in their disciplines.
