  Our story begins in early 2019, when Daniel, founder of Rowen Education, started helping friends navigate the university application process. Having just completed his bachelor's degree at the University of St. Gallen (HSG) and begun a master’s program at the London School of Economics (LSE), he continued offering this support in parallel with his studies and eventually also investigated the most optimal uses of artificial intelligence in academic career counselling within his master’s thesis, while presenting at various high schools to 150+ students about the academic system and associated opportunities. Having himself received study offers from universities such as Columbia University in the City of New York, New York University (NYU), and University College London (UCL), he was able to help each student gain admission to their top-choice postgraduate programs, including institutions such as the University of Vienna, the Technical University of Denmark, and ETH Zurich.
</p>
<p>
  When the pandemic struck, the project was put on hold, and Daniel shifted his focus toward physics and mathematics, which he pursued at institutions such as Trinity College Dublin and ETH Zurich, among others. Since his passion to the academic endeavour never left him, five years later, while studying at ETH Zurich, he returned to his earlier interest in academic and career counselling by earning an ETH Certificate in Coaching Students and decided to rebuild the entire service.
</p>
<p>
  However, this time with a broader and more holistic approach to navigating the academic system at both the high school and university levels—not just the application process but its full spectrum. The aim is to allow students to unlock their true potential and thrive in an ever-changing world by becoming the leaders of tomorrow in their respective disciplines.
</p>

<p>
  That is how Rowen Education emerged.
</p>
<p>
  The name <em>Rowen</em> was specifically chosen as a variant of <em>Rowan</em> (the tree), which in Celtic and Norse mythology symbolizes wisdom, protection, and insight. The Rowan tree was traditionally planted near homes or schools to ward off evil and protect the spirit of learning—sometimes even called the “Tree of the Poets” or the “Wizard’s Tree.”
</p>
<p>
  Evoking natural growth, resilience, and intellectual clarity, it was the perfect fit for naming this ambitious intellectual endeavour.
</p>
<p>
  Hence the motto of our company:<br>
  <strong>Rooted in Curiosity. Growing Through Understanding.</strong>
