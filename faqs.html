        Who is Rowen Education for?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Rowen Education is for high school and university students who are seeking to unlock their full academic potential and make the most of their academic journey. We support students during their studies by offering a wide range of academic guidance, as well as assistance with applications to various academic programs. This includes extracurricular opportunities as well as further studies—whether it’s applying for a specific bachelor’s degree, summer school, or a master’s program.

      <button class="faq-question">
        How should we start?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        We offer a non-binding conversation with one of our academic mentors. During this initial discussion, the mentor will walk you through the entire process—what the journey could look like, what’s possible, and offer a first impression of how we might support and guide the student during their studies.

        How much does a consultation with Rowen Education cost?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        The cost depends on the type of academic support the student needs. For example, it varies depending on whether the student is applying to a specific bachelor’s or master’s program, seeking guidance during their current studies, preparing for specific examinations during high school, or simply looking for ongoing mentoring and navigation through high school or a university degree.

        Why Rowen Education?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        Our founder realized that many students miss out on opportunities simply because they’re unaware of them—or due to social or other barriers. Rowen Education was created to help students truly seize these opportunities, excel in their academic paths, make informed decisions about further studies, and drastically improve their experience in any academic institution.

      <button class="faq-question">
        What makes Rowen Education different from other services?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        The key difference is our human and personal approach, combined with deep field experience. Our founder has studied at around ten different universities and received offers from some of the world’s most prestigious institutions in both Europe and the US. With a strong network of people at top universities, we are uniquely positioned to guide students toward these institutions—or through them—and help them make the best possible choices.

    <div class="faq-item">
      <button class="faq-question">
        When is the ideal time to start working with Rowen Education?
        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
      </button>
      <div class="faq-answer">
        The simple answer is: the earlier, the better. Starting early allows us to provide the most comprehensive support needed to help students reach their goals.
        <br><br>
        For example, if a student is already in the final year of high school, it can be quite challenging to navigate them toward top universities—it may be too late to check all the boxes those institutions require. However, if a student begins working with us in the first year of high school, we can guide them through numerous extracurricular and outside-of-school opportunities, help them prepare for standardized testing well in advance, and make sure they’re aware of everything they need to accomplish before university applications even begin.
        <br><br>
        The same applies to university students. With early guidance, we can help them structure their studies effectively—whether it’s learning how to prepare for specific types of exams or how to make the most of university resources. This kind of tailored support can make their university experience far more successful and enjoyable, avoiding unnecessary struggles or inefficient study methods.
