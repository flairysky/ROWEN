  title: "From NYU to Cornell: A Journey of Growth",
  qa: [
    {
      question: "Why did you choose NYU and then decide to transfer to Cornell?",
      answer: "As crazy (and expensive) as it may sound, I applied to about 14 different colleges and universities during my senior year of high school. It wasn’t so much that I didn’t know where I wanted to go, but more that I wanted to go everywhere! I looked at schools all across the United States, from New York to Chicago to Los Angeles. In the end, I was fortunate enough to get accepted to the majority of places where I applied. Then came the difficult decision of choosing where to go."
    },
    {
      question: "",
      answer: "I was actually waitlisted from Cornell University and was choosing between Berkeley, University of Chicago and NYU. I ended up being given a guaranteed option to transfer to Cornell after my first year, so was really just deciding where to spend that one year before ending up at my final destination. I chose NYU to be in the center of everything. New York has it all – Broadway, museums, great restaurants, etc. The university itself is world renowned, especially for business and the arts, and I couldn’t turn down the opportunity to study in the heart of the East Village of NYC."
    },
    {
      question: "",
      answer: "Eventually though, I did take Cornell up on the transfer option and moved to Ithaca, NY for my second year of school. Cornell had the more traditional, Ivy League, campus environment that I craved. The School of Industrial and Labor Relations is the best there is, and I knew I wanted to learn more about the people side of business."
    },
    {
      question: "What did you like about your university the most?",
      answer: "The best thing about being at NYU was being literally in the center of everything. On my way to class each day, I would pass by artists, people in business, and even the occasional celebrity. There’s no official campus for NYU, you’re just a New Yorker walking through Washington Square Park like everybody else, only you’re heading to class to learn about comparative politics or Roman history. Because of our location, it wasn’t uncommon for assignments to incorporate aspects of New York life, such as class trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art or National History Museum to get an up-close view at what we were learning about."
    },
    {
      question: "",
      answer: "Cornell, on the other hand, is fairly secluded in upstate New York and therefore has more to offer in terms of a traditional college experience. I absolutely loved the grassy quads, the incredible architecture of the buildings, and the historical “traditions” such as Dragon Day or Slope Day (look them up if interested!). I truly felt like I was in an intellectual bubble of higher learning that has shaped who I am today."
    },
    {
      question: "What did you not expect that pleasantly surprised you?",
      answer: "As cliché as it may sound, the two absolute best surprises and experiences I had while in school were meeting new people and going through personal development & growth. Right from the beginning, I had the mindset that college life was going to be an amazing and incredible journey. At both universities, the people I met truly made me a better person, while the experiences I had helped me to grow and explore my passions in life. The good food in the dining halls was also a nice surprise."
    },
    {
      question: "What advice would you give to students who are preparing to apply to demanding universities?",
      answer: "During the application process, it’s important to show universities that you know about them and that you also know yourself. What they’re looking for is for you to identify why you’re interested in joining their community and what you can bring to the table. After all, it’s not just for 3 or 4 years – it’s something that you can be a part of for the rest of your life. I do think it’s important to differentiate yourself in some way. Many people have good grades or strong extracurriculars. What’s important is that you incorporate personal aspects of your own life and upbringing into the process to show why you’re the best candidate."

  name: "Luca",
  title: "A Global Path in Economics: From St. Gallen to Barcelona via Tokyo and London",
  qa: [
    {
      question: "Why did you choose the trouble to go all the way through so many different universities?",
      answer: "Each destination held a specific meaning for me. I had always been curious about Japanese culture and wanted to spend at least a semester in Japan. I was fortunate to be selected for an exchange program during my bachelor studies at the University of St. Gallen. Afterwards, I knew I wanted to see more of the world and immerse myself in different academic environments. That’s why I went to London — a uniquely international city where students from across the globe come together, especially at LSE. Lastly, since my passion lies in macroeconomics, I chose to pursue my PhD at the Pompeu Fabra u\University in Barcelona, where the department is particularly strong in this field."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you pick a specific thing out of each university that you would like to highlight?",
      answer: "At the University of St. Gallen, I really appreciated the broad foundational education. Even as an economics student, we were required to take courses in law, finance, and business, which gave me a well-rounded perspective. In Tokyo, the learning system was entirely different from what I was used to in Europe — it was fascinating to see alternative approaches to academic topics. At LSE in London, I enjoyed the very rigorous and focused curriculum, especially in macroeconomics. The depth of specialization contrasted sharply with the broader approach at St. Gallen. And in Spain, I’ve truly valued the large and active economics department, where I can collaborate and freely exchange ideas with many colleagues."
    },
    {
      question: "How about the living environment around the places? What surprised you?",
      answer: "I was especially surprised by how safe I felt in Tokyo — even safer than in many parts of Western Europe. This stood in contrast to cities like Barcelona or even London, where one has to be a bit more cautious. But each place has its perks. In Spain, for example, our university is located right by the sea, offering stunning views. And despite London’s rainy weather, you could experience almost every culture in the world within one city."
